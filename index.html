                Hello my name is Aslak Jakob Bennedsen and i am 23 years old.
                I grew up in copenhagen, and i have lived there for most of my life,
                except for 2.5 years, where i lived in france, when i was 8.
                I went to a public school called oesterfarimagsgade skole, followed 
                by high school at christianshavns gymnasium. Last year i also went to hoejskole
                for 6 months where i studied psychology, politics and a little economics.

              <h2 onclick="toggleVisibility('work')">Jobs</h2>
              <p id='work'>
                During my second year in high school i had a job at a firm called flyhjaelp.
                There we helped customers whose flight was delayed, get compensation from airline.
                Following high school i worked as a phone salesman for four months. Just after 
                I quit as a phone salesman, i broke my ankle skateboarding. It was a complicated injury,
                followed by an infection in the foot resulting in a total of 5 surgeries and 7 months on crutches.
                The 6th month on crutches i got a job at a firm called insurello, there i helped insurance
                customers get money from their insurances. Then i had a job as a bartender for 3 months.
                Now i am working at a call center in greece.

              <h2 onclick="toggleVisibility('Self')">My Self Education</h2>
              <p id='Self'>
                During my time at home on crutches, i started learning, and i started learning a lot.
                Prior to the injury i had started reading non-fiction books, and started playing chess.
                Now was the perfect time to pick up the pace. I have read a lot of psychology, economics,
                history, i especially like game theory and behavioural economics. I have also learned spanish,
                german and i am working on greek, which now makes me able to speak five languages (excluding greek).
                After learning german, i started coding, which i really love. I am also gonna apply for psychology at
                a university in april.
